**Project Proposal:** Improving the rating of a movie/TV series will inevitably increase its box office revenue, and understanding the different factors contributing to a movie’s high rating explains its success. We look at over 2.5 million rows of movies and TV series from the IMDB website to understand people's preferences in a show’s composition, and we also look for ways to increase a show’s rating based on selected data. In addition, we analyze the relationship between the rating of movies and their compositions (duration/votes/certificate/etc.) to provide recommendations to increase revenue for production companies.
**Data Source:**

**Motivation:** Films and television series are entertainment topics closely related to people’s lives. By analyzing various factors contributing to a successful film, it is meaningful to discover how a movie/series should be produced that is preferred by spectators while bringing the most revenue to the companies producing it. Although it sounds ideal initially, producing an attractive and profitable show with data analytics is not without precedents, such as the success of Netflix’s House of Cards was based on extensive analytics on viewer data.
**Report Summary:** By examining the effects of `genre`, `certificate`, `duration`, and director on the rating of works, we draw the conclusion that, starting in 2008, consumers began to favor TV dramas over action movies as their preferred genre.Therefore, the talk show reappearance may be more popular with the audience. TV shows typically have high average ratings over relatively short periods of time in the certificates, but movies typically have low average ratings during longer average durations. TV shows may therefore earn more money when production costs are not taken into account. We draw the conclusion that the quantity of films a director produces has no bearing on the quality of those films based on the findings of our survey of directors. As a result, the quantity of a filmmaker's film and television productions need not be a major consideration when a film or television company selects a director.
